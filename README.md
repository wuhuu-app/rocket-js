# ðŸš€ Rocket

> **Current status:** Work in progress.

Rocket is a JavaScript library for making API request in a simple and easy way. It provides a bucket of useful APIs, such as root url configuration, content type auto-conversion, ultra-fast response handler, embedded header auth, and more.

In the most recent version, Rocket wraps the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library, so you can still enjoy all benefits from Axios while using Rocket.
