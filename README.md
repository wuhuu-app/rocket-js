> **Current status:** Work in progress.

Rocket is a JavaScript library for you to make API requests in a simple and easy way. It provides a series of useful APIs, such as root configuration, content type auto-conversion, ultra-fast response handler, embedded header auth, and more.

In the most recent version, Rocket wraps the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library, so you can also enjoy all benefits from Axios while using the Rocket.
